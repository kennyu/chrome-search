# Chrome-Search Extension

The goal of the Chrome Extension is to allow you to search through your the contents of your tab history. Information is all local.



This extension uses a WASM-based SQLite DB and stores all the non-private content of your tabs ( formatted through Readability )

Eventually, I intend to pair this with an LLM.
